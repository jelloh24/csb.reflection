"That the novitate is made up of young men who have only recently left the world, who have not yet lost its spirit.
It would be dangerous for them to reenter the world so soon. Your parish is so near Paris that there are crowds of people
on the streets. There are some people who will make fun of the brothers, abuse them, and make them lose heart in their
vocation. These are the reasons why I asked permission to have this private chapel which seems to you to be against the
laws of the church" - <b>St. John Baptist de La Salle</b><br><br>

This quote  tells me to always fight on what you believe in, just as long it can help others. Make sacrifices because it can help not only yourself but others as well.He also wants to be the face of the poor people who wants to continue their studies until they will finish their studies.His project will really help many poor people to have a good education.It will help the people to get a good job, to have a descent and beautiful life or living for their family or future family.We can say that in every learning experience of a human being, there should always be values or virtues along with acquiring new knowledge.<br><br>


I think that he tells us that when we are experiencing hard times to anything, we give up and forgot the faith in our Lord, God. Saint Jean Baptiste De La Salle knows that all of the people that believes in God have faith in Him, but he noticed that they are forgetting their faith in God when the time that they are feeling down where the faith to God is much needed. And what we need is to believe and have faith in God everytime even if we are experiencing hard times or even if we are just relaxing in life. We must not forget that God have mercy and loves us all.The pains of one's sacrifice are never in vain. There is always reward in something you do.

St. John Baptist de La Salle's line,"we should value our time doing things in an old fashion way".Let's not rush things, enjoy every second of our time because we cannot go back in time we just nid to value are time because every minutes counts is GOLD.
